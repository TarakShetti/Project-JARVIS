# Project-JARVIS
JARVIS Local AI Assistant
JARVIS is a personal voice assistant application built using Python, which can interact with the user via voice commands.
provide functionalities such as playing music, telling the current time, retrieving Wikipedia summaries, telling jokes, and opening local applications. The user interface features a dynamic animated "snake" effect, making the assistant's interaction more visually appealing.

**Features**
Voice Recognition: Responds to voice commands and can perform actions such as playing music, telling the time, searching Wikipedia, telling jokes, etc.
Voice Feedback: Uses text-to-speech (TTS) to speak back to the user.
Application Control: Opens local applications such as Notepad, Calculator, Chrome, Microsoft Office apps (Word, Excel, etc.), and more.
Real-Time Updates: Status messages are displayed in the GUI to show the assistant's actions.
Animated Snake: The GUI includes an animated snake effect that adds a fun and dynamic visual element to the app.

**Requirements**
To run this project, you need Python and the following libraries:

speech_recognition (for voice recognition)
pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech conversion)
pywhatkit (for interacting with YouTube and other services)
wikipedia (for fetching data from Wikipedia)
pyjokes (for telling jokes)
tkinter (for creating the graphical user interface)
math (for the snake animation)

**Commands**
Here are some sample voice commands you can give to JARVIS:

Play music: "JARVIS, play [song name]."
Tell the time: "JARVIS, what time is it?"
Search Wikipedia: "JARVIS, who is [person name]?"
Tell a joke: "JARVIS, tell me a joke."
Open applications: "JARVIS, open [application name]." (e.g., "notepad", "calculator", "chrome")
The assistant also responds to commands like "who are you", "what can you do", or "stop" to end the session.
